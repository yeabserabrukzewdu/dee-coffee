      longDescription: `Yirgacheffe is synonymous with the highest quality washed coffees in the world. Located in the Gedeo Zone, the micro-climates here are perfect for growing dense, flavor-packed cherries.

      Our Yirgacheffe Grade 1 is meticulously processed at our partner washing stations. The coffee is fermented for 36-48 hours, washed with pristine spring water, and dried on African raised beds for 12-15 days.
      
      The result is a cup of exceptional clarity. You can expect intense floral aromas reminiscent of jasmine and honeysuckle, backed by citrusy brightness (lemon, bergamot) and a delicate, tea-like body. It is the quintessential Ethiopian coffee experience.`,

      name: 'Guji',
      description: 'Intense strawberry, blueberry, and sweet finish.',
      longDescription: `Historically often grouped with Sidama, Guji has emerged as a distinct powerhouse region producing some of the most sought-after natural processed coffees in the world. The rich, red volcanic soil and high altitudes (up to 2,300m) create a unique terroir.
      
      Our Guji Natural Grade 1 is a fruit bomb. The cherries are dried whole, allowing the sugars from the fruit pulp to migrate into the bean. This creates a creamy, syrupy body with explosive berry flavors.
      
      In the cup, you will find distinct notes of strawberry jam, blueberry, and tropical fruits, often with a lingering sweetness that lasts long after the final sip.`,

    'sidama': {
      name: 'Sidama',

      longDescription: `Sidama is one of the most productive and famous coffee regions in Ethiopia. It offers a incredible diversity of flavors due to its massive geographic spread.
      
      Our Sidama coffees are known for their balance. They bridge the gap between the delicate florals of Yirgacheffe and the wild fruitiness of Harrar. We offer both washed and natural preparations from this region.
      
      A typical Sidama cup features a rounded body with notes of sweet lemon, milk chocolate, and sometimes a hint of wine or spice. It is an incredibly versatile coffee, perfect for single-origin espresso or high-end blends.`,
      tastingNotes: 'Milk Chocolate, Lemon, Spice, Wine, Walnut',
    },
    'harrar': {
      name: 'Harrar',
      description: 'The original mocha. Heavy body, spicy, dried fruit.',
      longDescription: `Harrar is where the legend of coffee began. Located in the eastern highlands, the beans here are almost exclusively natural processed and are famous for their "mocha" flavor—a term originally derived from the port of Mocha in Yemen, but describing the chocolatey character of these beans.
      
      Harrar coffees are wild, gamey, and intense. They are grown in drier climates, which stresses the trees and concentrates the flavors in the bean.
      
      Expect a full, heavy body with complex notes of dark chocolate, dried fruits (dates, raisins), and exotic spices like cardamom and cinnamon. It is a coffee with a rugged, ancient soul.`,

      longDescription: `Limmu is located in the Oromia region in western Ethiopia. While historically overshadowed by the southern regions, Limmu is gaining rapid recognition for its high-quality washed coffees.
      
      Unlike the bright, citric acidity of Yirgacheffe, Limmu coffees are known for a "winey" acidity and a syrupy mouthfeel. The region remains home to many ancient, indigenous forests where coffee grows semi-wild.
      
      Our Limmu offerings are sweet and spicy, often presenting flavors of brown sugar, cinnamon, and red wine, with a balanced acidity that makes for a very smooth cup.`,

    'bale': {

      longDescription: `The Bale Mountains contain the Harenna Forest, one of the few remaining natural cloud forests in Ethiopia. Coffee here grows wild under the canopy of massive trees, completely untouched by modern chemicals or fertilizers.
      
      Sourcing from Bale is a logistical challenge but worth the effort. The "Wild Forest" coffee offers a unique profile distinct from the garden coffees of the south.
      
      This profile is often herbal and complex, with notes of stone fruits (apricot, plum) and a deep, forest-floor sweetness. It is a coffee for the adventurous drinker looking to taste the origin of the species.`,
